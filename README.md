# -dictionary-storage
a python program that takes in product name and price and stores these in a dictionary
with the product name as key and the product price as the value.

i later realised that this program can be made more robust, if you wrap all the code in a function.
it would be much easier to use the thing as a library, i'm just a bit lazy to do it though.
